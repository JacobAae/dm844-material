= Grails Domain Classes

== Domain Classes

* Getting stuff into the database
* Querying to get it back

NOTE: As a start, we will just use the H2 database, in memory. Later we will configure Grails to use a different database. There are support for a large number of databases: Postgres, MySQL, Oracle DB, Mongo DB etc.

We still don't have to use SQL, GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapper) and the underlying layer (Typically http://hibernate.org/[Hibernate]) handles this for us. Even better, you don't have to define XML mappings anywhere.


== Create the first domain class

In the *interactive console*

 create-domain-class dk.844.bsg.Ship

TIP: The *interactive console* has auto-completion

Output:

----
grails> create-domain-class dk.dm844.bsg.Ship
| Created file grails-app/domain/dk/dm844/bsg/Ship.groovy
| Created file test/unit/dk/dm844/bsg/ShipSpec.groovy
----

Notic that a test class is automatically created.


== Lets add the Shiptype enum in src/groovy

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
package dk.dm844.bsg

enum Shiptype {

	MILITARY,
	ADMINISTRATION,
	FREIGHT,
	ACCOMODATION,
	PRODUCTION,
	MISC

}
----

== Adding properties

Add these properties to the Ship class

 String name
 Shiptype shiptype
 Integer crewsize
 Date productionDate
 String description



== Cheating ahead - Scaffolding constructor

In the *interactive console*

 create-controller dk.dm844.bsg.Ship

Open ShipController and add this line in the class

 static scaffold = true

instead of the `index` method

 run-app

And click the ShipController link

<<<

Notice the constraints are not implemented, i.e.

* The description is apparently required
* I can make a ship with a crew of only 5
* Two ships can have the same name

IMPORTANT: We should add tests that show these problems, and then solve them


== Dynamically added methods

On domain object, Grails adds lots of methods

* validate
* save
* get
* list
* delete
* findBy...
* findAllBy...
* hasErrors

and more.

== Tool: The grails console

From the terminal

 grails console

Spins up a Groovy console, but with access to Grails Domain objects, and their generated methods

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
import dk.dm844.bsg.*

Ship ship = new Ship()

println ship.validate()
println ship.errors
----



== Dbconsole

When you run in development mode, you can access the database with the dbconsole, go to http://localhost:8080/app-name/dbconsole

image::dbconsole.png[]

The string for *JDBC URL* can be found in the fil _grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy_




== Testing Domain Objects

Lets take a detour to the Spock Framework


== Unit Testing Constraints

Add this to your `ShipSpec` class

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
def setup() {
    // Adds the validate method to the domain (or command object) class
    mockForConstraintsTests(Ship)
}
----

And lets write some tests for the constraints on the ship class


== Integration Testing Domain Objects

TIP: Integration testing uses a real database, not just a mocked one, and is the safe choice for testing interaction with the database

In the *interactive console*

 create-integration-test dk.dm844.Ship

<<<

Lets write a few Spock tests checking we can save, retrieve and search for ships in the database

== Problems

*Implement the following, and test the constraints*

* Every ship must have a radio code with the following properties
** The length must be 5 characters
** The first 2 characters are letters from the ship name
** The third character must be a ':'
** The last 2 characters are digits, and the first must be odd, the last even
