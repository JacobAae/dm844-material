= Spock Testing

== Intro

* Testing Framework for Java and Groovy
* Based on Groovy
* Fully compatible with JUnit
* Created by Peter Niederwiesser (now with Gradleware)
* Should have been version 1.0 long ago
* Should also have had a logo long ago.
* Awesome still
* Name comes from Specification and Mock
* Can handle different testing methodologies
** State Based Testing
** Data Driven Testing
** Interaction Based Testing


== Nice features

* Reduce the lines of test code
* Make tests more readable
* Turn tests into specifications



== Classical Unit Testing

 Arrange
 Act
 Assert


== Elements

* Blocks
** setup
** cleanup
** expect
** given
** when
** then
** where
** and:

<<<

* Fixture Methods
** setup()
** cleanup()
** setupSpec()
** cleanupSpec()
* Instance and @Shared fields
* `old()` and `thrown()`



== State Based Testing

TIP: Classical Unit Testing

 Arrange
 Act
 Assert

[options="step"]
In Spock

 Given-When-Then


[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
void "The name of the test in a string"() {

    given:
    // Preconditions, testdata etc

    when:
    // Action

    then:
    // Expected reaction - that evaluates to boolean
}
----


== Data Driven Testing

[options="step"]
* Test the same behavior...
* with varying data!

[options="step"]
TIP: You can use the `where` clause, to generate a test for each row of data

* where: block
** Data tables
* @Unroll annotation


== Interaction Based Testing

* Design and test how your objects communicate
* Mocking frameworks to the rescue
* Spock comes with its own mocking framework
