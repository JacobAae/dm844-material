= Spock Testing

== Philosophy

"Never trust a test you havn't seen fail"
-- Everyone that nows testing!

== Intro to Spock

* Testing Framework for Java and Groovy
* Based on Groovy
* Fully compatible with JUnit
* Created by Peter Niederwiesser (now with Gradleware)
* Should have been version 1.0 long ago
* Should also have had a logo long ago.
* Awesome still
* Name comes from Specification and Mock
* Can handle different testing methodologies
** State Based Testing
** Data Driven Testing
** Interaction Based Testing


== Nice features

* Reduce the lines of test code
* Make tests more readable
* Turn tests into specifications



== Classical Unit Testing

 Arrange
 Act
 Assert


== Elements

* Blocks
** setup
** cleanup
** expect
** given
** when
** then
** where
** and:

<<<

* Fixture Methods
** setup()
** cleanup()
** setupSpec()
** cleanupSpec()
* Instance and @Shared fields
* `old()` and `thrown()`



== Minimal Spock Spec

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::../test/groovy/dk/dm844/groovyintro/SpockDemo.groovy[]
----


== Stand Alone Spec

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@Grab('org.spockframework:spock-core:0.7-groovy-2.0')
import spock.lang.*

class DemoSpec extends Specification {

    void "Simple spock multiplication test"() {
        expect:
        2 + 3 == 4
    }
}
----

== State Based Testing

TIP: Classical Unit Testing

 Arrange
 Act
 Assert

In Spock

 Given
 When
 Then

<<<

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
void "The name of the test in a string"() {

    given:
    // Preconditions, testdata etc

    when:
    // Action

    then:
    // Expected reaction - that evaluates to boolean
}
----

<<<


[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
void "The name of the test in a string"() {

    setup:
    // Test data creation

    expect:
    // Expectations that evaluates to boolean

    cleanup:
    // If something needs to be cleaned up

}
----


== Data Driven Testing

* Test the same behavior...
* with varying data!

TIP: You can use the `where` clause, to generate a test for each row of data

* where: block
** Data tables
* @Unroll annotation

== Using the where clause


[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::../test/groovy/dk/dm844/groovyintro/MoreSpockDemo.groovy[tags=where-clause]
----


== Useful Annotations

* @Ignore
* @IgnoreRest
* @FailsWith
* @Timeout
* @Stepwise


== Interaction Based Testing

* Design and test how your objects communicate
* Mocking frameworks to the rescue
* Spock comes with its own mocking framework


WARNING: More on this when we reach controllers and services! We usually don't need mocking, spying and stubbing when testing Domain classes ;)
