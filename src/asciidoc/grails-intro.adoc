= Grails Introduction


== MVC Framework

[options="step"]
* Model-View-Controller
* Architecture that separates presentation and interaction
* *Model* Database objects, having some business rules as constraints
* *View* The presentation of data (HTML, JSON, XML, diagrams etc.)
* *Controller* Handles the possibilities for getting data shown
* Central ideas
** Reusability of code
** Separation of responsibilities

== Grails History

* *2006* Grails goes (beta), but is started the year before
* *2008* Grails in 1.0 and Springsource buys G2One.
* *2009* VMWare buys Springsource
* *2011* Grails 2.0 - improved testing options, performance etc
* *2012* Pivotal created from VMWare, inherits Grails and Groovy
* *Now*
** Grails version 2.4.4 is Latest stable
** Grails 3.0 Milestone 1
** Searching for new funding for core teams

== Editor Support

=== IntelliJ
Has excellent support, and Jetbrains have issued a School Licence for SDU

=== Eclipse
Ok support in GGTS - Groovy Grails ToolSuite

=== Netbeans
I have not tried, but some support should be available

== Getting Started

Install Grails

*Linux/Mac:* Use GVM

 gvm install grails 2.4.4

*Windows*

Videoguide at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu3GgjuUOtg[Youtube] by Mike Kelly (Use Java 7 or 8 and Grails 2.4.4)


== First Grails App

INFO: We will create an application that can help the president and admiral in Battlestar Galactica to keep track of the ships in the fleet, and register persons and crisis' that have happened (and who has been involved in which).

In the console

  grails create-app bsg

== Focus on


* Convention over configuration
* Quick getting started - through scaffolding, auto-reloading etc.
* Testing (with Spock)
** Unit and integration testing are first class citizens
** Functional testing with a plugin


== Starting the app

You can start Grails in *interactive mode* just by issuing the `grails` command

There you can use `run-app` to spin up the application

When you do so, the application can be visited at

 http://localhost:8080/bsg

Use `stop-app` to stop it from running (right now it is quite boring!). `exit` leaves interactive mode.


== Requirements for our simple app

=== Ships

* Each ship has a name, and no two ships can have the same name. The name of a ship cannot be longer than 60 characters
* Each ship has a type, and the types are Military, Administration, Freight, Accomodation, Production, Misc.
* Each ship must register the crewsize, and no sjips can have a crew smaller than 8
* Each ship must have a production date
* It should be possible to add a description to each ship, and this can be quite long (up to 10.000 characters)

=== Persons

* Each person has a name and (optionally) a title (doctor, major, admiral etc.)
* We must register each persons date of birth
* Each person must bellong to some ship

=== Crisis

* A crisis has a header on no longer than 75 characters (for display in lists etc), and also a longer description.
* A crisis can be assigned a main culprit and a one or more persons that solved the crisis
* We must also be able to register if the crisis has been solved
* If it is ot the entire fleet, we registrer which ships are affected by the crisis


== Model

image::bsg-domain-model.png[]

== Some methods

We know that the application needs some data

* Person should have a `isMilitary` method, returning true if the person belongs to a ship with type Military
* A person object should be able to deliver information on crisis where the person is either the culprit or if the person helped solve the crisis
...


== Starting

Lets make sure the datamodel is implemented first, and no invalid data can make it to the database.

WARNING: Constraints as well as methods should be tested!
