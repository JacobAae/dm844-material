== Code Review

== Why and How

*Why*

* Better quality code
* Feedback - so we learn from each other
* More uniform codebase
* Potential problems spottet early

*How*

* _Over-the-shoulder_ – One developer looks over the author's shoulder as the latter walks through the code.
* _Email pass-around_ – Source code management system emails code to reviewers automatically after checkin is made.
* _Pair Programming_ – Two authors develop code together at the same workstation, such is common in Extreme Programming.
* _Tool-assisted code review_ – Authors and reviewers use software tools, informal ones such as pastebins and IRC, or specialized tools designed for peer code review.


== General

* Does the code do what it was supposed to solve
* Is it understandable
* Is it readable

== Naming

Is the naming correct of:

* Artefacts: Domain Classes, Controllers, Services, TagLibs
* Classes and methods
* packages
* Variables - and does the name make sence?


== Readability

* Use of _one-liners_ that are hard to read
* Spock tests and labels
* White space where needed (around operators)
* Curly braces where needed


== Comments

* Is the comments correct
* Does methods have javadoc?

== Complexity

* Could the code be written simpler/more elegant

== Tone of feedback

* Be nice
* Comment also when there is something positive
