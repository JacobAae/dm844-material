= Monitoring, DNS, etc.

== Intro

* Monitoring the application is alive
* Monitoring performance
* Domain name and DNS
* SSL


== Monitoring/Alarms

You will most likely want to be notified in case your application is not available.

http://uptimerobot.com/ is one way.

== Monitoring Performance

New relic can be installed, to give you a view of how your server is. And give a hint where you could have performance bottlenecks.

Sign up at http://newrelic.com

You need to monitor with APM a Java application

<<<

You should retrieve your licence key, and the java agent.

On your server, you can make a dir for newrelic, at fx

 /var/lib/tomcat7/newrelic

Extract the files in the zip (use unzip newrelic-java-3.15.0.zip), and make sure tomcat is the owner of the files

 chown -R tomcat7:tomcat7 newrelic/

<<<

In the _newrelic.yml_ file, you should include your licence key, where it says to:

  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account. For example, if your license key is 12345 use this:
  # license_key: '12345'
  # The key binds your Agent's data to your account in the New Relic service.
  license_key: '<%= license_key %>'

You should also change the name of your application.

TIP: Notice you can also in here disable the monitoring just by a boolean flag.


<<<

You should make a  _setenv.sh_ file to store settings. Make a lib called bin at

 /var/lib/tomcat7/bin

And make a file there `setenv.sh` with this content:

 export CATALINA_OPTS="${CATALINA_OPTS} -javaagent:/opt/po/newrelic/newrelic.jar"

Make sure everything is owned by tomcat7!

 chown tomcat7:tomcat7 -R ./bin

WARNING: Study `/usr/share/tomcat7/bin/catalina.sh` to see why this naming and placement is important.


<<<

When you restart your tomcat server

 service tomcat7 restart

You should see something similar to this in the log

 Apr 28, 2015 15:08:55 -0400 [9868 1] com.newrelic INFO: New Relic Agent: Loading configuration file "/var/lib/tomcat7/newrelic/./newrelic.yml"
 Apr 28, 2015 15:08:56 -0400 [9868 1] com.newrelic INFO: New Relic Agent: Writing to log file: /var/lib/tomcat7/newrelic/logs/newrelic_agent.log

This log you find at logs/catalina.out

The log for new relic you can find at: newrelic/logs/newrelic_agent.log and you can configure placement, level etc in the newrelic.yml file.

== Domain Name
You can register your domain name muliple places.
One of them is http://www.gratisdns.dk

There you can also handle DNS.

<<<

<<<

Assuming you go for a .dk domain, you will later need to login at DK Hostmaster and confirm your domain registration.

You will receive an email and a paper letter with this:

image::dk-hostmaster.png[]

You will also receive an email with DNS info.

<<<

== DNS

image::DNS-1.png[]

TIP: If you need mail for your domain, this is also the pace to configure the DNS for it

<<<

Until you have confirmed the domain, and the DNS is updated, your output wil look like this:

 nslookup dm844demo.dk
 ;; Got SERVFAIL reply from 127.0.1.1, trying next server
 ;; Got SERVFAIL reply from 192.168.9.121, trying next server
 Server:		192.168.9.122
 Address:	192.168.9.122#53

 server can't find dm844demo.dk: SERVFAIL


<<<

Later it looks like this

 nslookup dm844demo.dk

 Server:		127.0.1.1
 Address:	127.0.1.1#53

 Non-authoritative answer:
 Name:	dm844demo.dk
 Address: 188.166.10.168


== SSL + Apache

It is time to add a bit of security to the network part of our application.

 a2enmod ssl
 a2enmod rewrite
 service apache2 restart

Will enable the ssl module for apache

<<<

Create a dir and a certificate

 mkdir /etc/apache2/ssl
 openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt

Answer the questions, and make sure you in the *Common name* you should use your new domain name (or your IP)


== Configuring apache

You should reconfigure the apache virtual host to be ssl enabled!

----
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin jamik@imada.sdu.dk
  DocumentRoot "/var/www"

  RewriteEngine on
  ReWriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !^443$
  RewriteRule ^/(.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [NC,R,L]

</VirtualHost>
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerAdmin jamik@imada.sdu.dk
#  ServerName dm844demo.dk

  Alias /docs/ /var/www/docs/

  ErrorLog /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
  ProxyRequests off
  ProxyPass /jenkins http://127.0.0.1:8090/jenkins nocanon
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/ nocanon
  ProxyPassReverse /jenkins  http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins
  ProxyPassReverse /  http://127.0.0.1:8080/
  ProxyPreserveHost on

  <Proxy http://localhost:8080/*>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  </Proxy>
  <Proxy http://localhost:8090/jenkins>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  </Proxy>

  SSLEngine on
  SSLProtocol all  -SSLv2 -SSLv3

  SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.key

</VirtualHost>
----


<<<

You wil still see these warnings, since you have made a self-signed certificate.

image::ssl-1.png[]

<<<

image::ssl-2.png[]

<<<

image::ssl-3.png[]


If you wish to do this the right way, you need to buy a certificate

See fx https://ssl.gratisdns.dk/dcorder.php

RapidSSL is likely the cheapest (350 for 1 year, single domain)

For config see http://www.geotrust.com/resources/csr/apache_mod_ssl.htm
