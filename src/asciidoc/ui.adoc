== How We Use the Web

*Facts of life*

. We don't read pages. We scan them
. We don't make optimal choices. We sacrifice.
. We don't figure out how things woork. We muddle through.

== Web Design 101

* Design pages for scanning - not for reading
* Create a clear visual hierarchy
* Use conventions
* Break up pages into clearly defined areas
* Make it obvious what is clickable
* Keep the noise down

== The trunk test

Imagine you are blindfolded and locked in the trunk of a car.
Driven around for a while, and dumped on a page somewhere in a website!

If the page is well designed, you should be able to answer these questions without hesitation:

* What site is this? (Site ID)
* What page am i on? (Page name)
* What are the major sections at this level?
* What are my options at this level? (Local navigation)
* Where am I in the scheme of things? (You are here indicator)
* How can I search
