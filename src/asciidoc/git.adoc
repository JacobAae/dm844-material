= Git - Version Control


== Intro

image::git-chart.png[]

== Some definitions

*HEAD*

This is an alias for the tip of the current branch, which is the most recent commit you have made to that branch.

*Index*

The index, also known as the staging area, is the set of files that will become the next commit. It is also the commit that will become HEAD’s parent.

*Working Copy*

This is the term for the current set of files you’re working on in your file system.

== Installation

* *Ubuntu/Linux* `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* *Mac* `sudo port install git-core`
* *Windows* Download msysGit installer from http://msysgit.github.io/[] or as a part of cygwin


== Configuration

 git config --global user.name "Your name"
 git config --global user.email "username@student.sdu.dk"

Configure your favorite editor

 git config --global core.editor /path/to/editor

TIP: If you leave out the `--global` it is only for the repository you are currently in.

== Creating a repository

 mkdir example
 cd example

 git init

You should now be able to detect a .git folder

NOTE: Working tree: Your own files and folders - empty initially

== Towards your first commit

create readme.txt (use editor)

IMPORTANT: Staging area -> index

== What has changed

compare using

 git status

Dence form

 git status -s

== Editing, adding

 git add readme.txt

IMPORTANT: Adding a file to the index are is called _staging_

Edit again

 git add readme.txt

You can add all files in current repository

 git add -A

Or all updated files

 git add -u

Or stage chunks of a file (patching)

 git add -p

== Committing

Once you have added, you can commit by

 git commit -m "Initial commit of readme file"

If you leave the `-m "Your message"` out, you editor wil open, and you can write it there

== Ignoring files

Add a file named

 .gitignore

To the root of the project, and on each line define what is to be left out

*Example .gitignore file*
----
*~
logs/
*.class
----

== See the history

See the history

 git log

 git log --pretty=raw

IMPORTANT: Notice the signature of the content (a SHA hash of the snapshot)

See a specific commit:

 git show <git-hash>


== Graphical tools

* *Mac:* Source tree
* *Linux:* Gitg
* *Windows:* Git GUI

== Messed up a file

 git checkout readme.txt

Restores to original (last committed version)


== Difference between commits

 git diff <commit-id 1> <commit-id 2>


== Tagging

Lets tag the current version with version 0.1.0

 git tag 0.1.0

You can use the tags with git diff, to see changes between tags

 git diff 0.1.0 0.1.1


== Error in a staged filed

To undo staged changes in readme.txt

 git reset HEAD -- readme.txt

The `--` tells git that the command is done, and the rest are files (or paths)

Or if you wish to get rid of the changes totally

 git checkout -- readme.txt

== Error, and already pushed :(

You wish to revert the last commit you did:

 git revert <hash of the last commit>

You can also revert an older commit, but this may cause conflicts, if later commits have changed the file

== Moving and Deleting

You can move or delete files in git with the `mv` and `rm` commands

 git mv readme.txt readme.adoc
 git rm readme.txt

If it a directory, add `-r` for recursive

If you deleted something that has been committed previously, you can get it back with

 git reset HEAD -- readme.txt


== Branching

So far everything has been linear!

If we wish to develop a new (large) feature for our project, we could do this in a separate branch, enabling us to always fix a critical bug, if it arises.

TIP: We are already working in a branch, it is called *master*

 git branch

Will show all branches, now only the master branch exist, and it is active. At all times, a branch points to a specific commit. You can see this using

 git branch -v

== Creating a new branch

 git branch my-new-feature
 git branch -v

To switch between branches, use the checkout command

 git checkout my-new-feature
 git branch -v

To create a new branch and immediately switch to it `-b`

  git checkout -b ny-new-branch


== Developing a feature

Add a few commits to the new feature branch, and see how the pointers for the master branch is not affected

A branch is only a pointer to some commit!

Go back to the master branch, and notice that the content is not affected by the commits on the other branch, but is back to the original state.

CAUTION: What happens if you commit changes on the master branch?

== Merging

You can merge the changes from one branch to another using the merge branch. Lets merge from the my-new-feature down to master

 git merge my-new-feature

You may risk a conflict, if the same file has been modified on both branches. This you must resolve by hand, add and commit the merge.

 # Fix the conflict in an editor
 git add readme.txt
 git commit -m "Merged feature to master"
 git log -v

Look at the graphical tool, and it may be clear what happened


== Sharing with your collegues

Committing and sharing is not the same in git.
Committing only updates your local repository, to share with others, you need to `push`

Where to host your git repository

* Github
* Bitbucket
* Your own hosted repository
* ...

These are called remote repositories. Set the remote repositorie like this

 git remote add origin git@github.com:your-user/.....

<<<

after you have created a remote repository on Github (your code will be visible to the world)

Now you can *fetch*, *pull* and *push* commits to your remote repository, sharing it with others.

The first time you push, use

 git push -u origin master

Next time, just use

 git push

Notice all local commits are now visible.

push is fetching and merging in one.

== Fetch vs Pull

IMPORTANT: In short, `pull` does a `fetch` followed by a `merge`

The `fetch` never changes any of never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads,
and is safe to do without changing your working copy.

A `pull` is what you would do to bring a local branch up-to-date with its remote version,
while also updating your other remote-tracking branches.

WARNING: Some recommend to always `fetch` and `merge` instead of `pull` (I don't)

== Other contributers

 git clone git@github....

You now have another copy of your code a different place.

Make a commit, and use git log to see the master and the origin now are different. try also git status

 git log -v
 git status

Push your changes to github, and see that both your local and remote pointers point to the same commit

== Working on the same files

Go back to your first location, and make a change in the same file as you just did, commit it, and try to push. This will fail, and you will have to manually clean the conflict up, just like when you merged before from a branch.



== Rebasing

Instead of doing `fetch` and `merge` or `pull`, generating a merge commit, it is often cleaner to do a rebase

 git pull --rebase

This makes git try to replay your commits on top of the ones fetched from the repository.

<<<

In a graphical form this looks like

Given the following history:

       C---D---E local
      /
 A---B---F---G remote

The effect of a merge will be:

       C---D---E local
      /         \
 A---B---F---G---H remote

The effect of a rebase will be:

               C'--D'--E' local
              /
 A---B---F---G remote



== Amend to commit

If you have just made a commit, and have missed including a file etc, you can use

 git add readme.txt
 git commit --amend

If you have already pushed, you should make a new commit, as you don't know if anyone is already using the previous commit :(


== Handling conflicts

Which files needs to be resolved?

 git ls-files -u


----
Auto-merging readme.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in readme.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

In the file:
----
Hi,

Git can be
<<<<<<< HEAD
very
very
=======
very very
>>>>>>> dca88fdacd44373f08e60592d880b67ed957cdfe
tricky
----

Manually handle the difference, save, add and commit.



== Erase a commit

If you wish to remove a commit, you basically wish to move the pointer of *HEAD*.

 git reset HEAD~1

Will move the *HEAD* to one commit before the current *HEAD*

If you just wish to move the head pointer, and nothing more, you should use

 git reset --soft

Files in the index and working copy are not changed

The default is `mixed` mode, where it will reset the index to match the commit you are resetting to (but not the working tree)

 git reset --mixed

If you really (and be carefull here) wish to reset to the state of a commit, _deleting any non-committed changes_ following that, use `hard` mode

 git reset --hard


More on the reset command: http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html[]

WARNING: You may be able to recover some using the `reflog`, but this is non-trivial.



== Moving between branches

There are several ways you can move code between branches.

*Stashing*

If you accidentally started changing master, and it should have been a
feature branch, stashing is an easy way.

*Cherry-picking*

If you have already committed, you can cherry-pick the commits to another branch, and resetting the branch you changed by accident.

== Stashing

To temporarily store code, you can use

 git stash

And (possibly moving to another branch), retrieving it by

 git stash pop

You can see the stashes on the stack using

 git stash list

Stashing can also be used, if you wish to `pull` new code from the repository,
while you are working on uncommitted code.


== Cherry picking

If you wish to copy a specific commit from one branch to another, you can cherry-pick it.

Locate the sha-hash of the commit you wish to apply, and use

 git cherry-pick sha-hash-of-commit

If you wish to apply a range of commits, you can do it with some branchng and rebasing (not covered in this intro)


== Who did that?

To see who the author of specific lines in a file is:

 git blame example.txt


== Standard alias

You should immediately add these alias:

 git config --global alias.co checkout
 git config --global alias.br branch
 git config --global alias.ci commit
 git config --global alias.st status
 git config --global alias.cl clone



== Handy alias

 git config --global alias.st status -s
 git config --global alias.pr 'pull --rebase'
 git config --global alias.cp cherry-pick
 git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
 git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'

////
 git config --global alias.wipe !git add -A && git commit -qm 'WIPE SAVEPOINT' && git 'reset HEAD~1 --hard'
////

== Statistics

Statistics for the last 5 commits

 git diff --stat HEAD~5

Shorter summary

 git diff --shortstat HEAD~5

Statistics for the commit log

 git log --stat

Statistics for the commit log short summary

 git log --shortstat



== The reflog and 'detached HEAD' state

DANGER: Lets 'loose a few commits' that have not been pushed

But first, check out

 git reflog

Delete the last two commits

 git reset --hard HEAD~2
 git log --oneline

Auch - that was one too many commits deleted :(

<<<

 git reflog

Output:

----
027438c HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~2
bdb4b78 HEAD@{1}: commit: Nr 3
03c9245 HEAD@{2}: commit: Nr 2
027438c HEAD@{3}: commit (initial): Nr 1
----

Lets get them back

 git checkout bdb4b78

This will leave you in a 'detached HEAD' state. Branch the result using

 git checkout -b saving-branch
 git checkout master
 git merge saving-branch

Now check you have your commit back :)








== 5 Usefull Scenarios


TIP: You mess up your local branch and simply want to go back to what you had the last time you did a git pull:

----
 git reset --hard origin/master  # You will need to be comfortable doing this!
----

<<<



TIP: You start making changes locally, you edit half a dozen files and then, oh crap, you're still in the master (or another) branch:

----
git checkout -b new_branch_name  # just create a new branch
git add .                      # add the changes files
git commit -m"your message"    # and commit them
----

<<<

TIP: You mess up one particular file in your current branch and want to basically 'reset' that file (lose changes) to how it was the
     the last time you pulled it from the remote repository:

----
 git checkout your/directories/filename

This actually resets the file (like many git commands it is not well named for what it is doing here).
----

<<<

TIP: You make some changes locally, you want to make sure you don't lose them while you do a git reset or rebase:

----
I often make a manual copy of the entire project (cp -r ../my_project ~/)
when I am not sure if I might mess up in git or lose important changes.
----

<<<

TIP: You are rebasing but things gets messed up:

----
git rebase --abort # To abandon interactive rebase and merge issues
----
