= Git - Version Control


== Intro

image::git-chart.png[]

== Installation

* *Ubuntu/Linux* `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* *Mac* `sudo port install git-core`
* *Windows* Download msysGit installer from http://msysgit.github.io/[] or as a part of cygwin


== Configuration

 git config --global user.name "Your name"
 git config --global user.email "username@student.sdu.dk"

Configure your favorite editor

 git config --global core.editor /path/to/editor


== Creating a repository

 mkdir example
 cd example

 git init
 ll

Working tree: Your own files and folders - empty initially

== Towards your first commit

create readme.txt (use editor)

Staging area: index

== What has changed

compare using

 git status

Dence form

 git status -s

== Editing, adding and committing

 git add readme.txt

Edit again

 git add readme.txt

Committing

 git commit -m "Initial commit of readme file"

== See the history

See the history

 git log

 git log --pretty=raw

INFO: Notice the signature of the content (a hash of the snapshot)

See a specific commit:

 git show <git-hash>


== Graphical tools

* *Mac:* Source tree
* *Linux:* Gitg
* *Windows:* Git GUI

== Messed up a file

 git checkout readme.txt

Restores to original (last committed version)

== Already committet :(

You wish to revert the last commit you did:

 git revert <hash of the last commit>

You can also revert an older commit, but this may cause conflicts, if later commits have changed the file


== Difference between commits

 git diff <commit-id 1> <commit-id 2>


== Tagging

Lets tag the current version with version 0.1.0

 git tag 0.1.0

You can use the tags with git diff, to see changes between tags

 git diff 0.1.0 0.1.1


== Branching

So far everything has been linear!

If we wish to develop a new (large) feature for our project, we could do this in a separate branch, enabling us to always fix a critical bug, if it arises.

TIP: We are already working in a branch, it is called *master*

 git branch

Will show all branches, now only the master branch exist, and it is active. At all times, a branch points to a specific commit. You can see this using

 git branch -v

== Creating a new branch

 git branch my-new-feature
 git branch -v

To switch between branches, use the checkout command

 git checkout my-new-feature
 git branch -v

== Developing a feature

Add a few commits to the new feature branch, and see how the pointers for the master branch is not affected

A branch is only a pointer to some commit!

Go back to the master branch, and notice that the content is not affected by the commits on the other branch, but is back to the original state.

CAUTION: What happens if you commit changes on the master branch?

== Merging

You can merge the changes from one branch to another using the merge branch. Lets merge from the my-new-feature down to master

 git merge my-new-feature

You may risk a conflict, if the same file has been modified on both branches. This you must resolve by hand, add and commit the merge.

 # Fix the conflict in an editor
 git add readme.txt
 git commit -m "Merged feature to master"
 git log -v

Look at the graphical tool, and it may be clear what happened


== Sharing with your collegues

* Github
* Bitbucket
* Your own hosted repository
* ...

These are called remote repositories. Set the remote repositorie like this

 git remote add origin git@github.com:your-user/.....

after you have created a remote repository on Github (your code will be visible to the world)

Now you can *pull* and *push* commits to your remote repository, sharing it with others.

The first time you push, use

 git push -u origin master

Next time, just use

 git push

Notice all local commits are now visible.

== Other contributers

 git clone git@github....

You now have another copy of your code a different place.

Make a commit, and use git log to see the master and the origin now are different. try also git status

 git log -v
 git status

Push your changes to github, and see that both your local and remote pointers point to the same commit

== Working on the same files

Go back to your first location, and make a change in the same file as you just did, commit it, and try to push. This will fail, and you will have to manually clean the conflict up, just like when you merged before from a branch.

== Rebasing












== Handy alias


 git config --global color.ui auto
 git config --global alias.lg "log --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr %an)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
