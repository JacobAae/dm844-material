= Groovy Introduction (for JAVA Programmers)

== Groovy?

* OO language for the JVM
* Java-like syntax
* Optional types
* Compiled
* Dynamic or Static - your choice!

== Compilation

== Source Code included

[source,groovy]
.HelloWorld.groovy
----
include::../groovy/HelloWorld.groovy[]
----


== Groovy intro

*Battle against verbosity*

* No semicolons
* Not all parenthesis are needed
* Elvis operator
* == vs. .equals
* Not necessary with constructors
* Groovy truth
* return keyword is optional
* Default imports
* Strings, and GStrings


== Optional Typing

TIP: *Duck typing*: If it walks and talks like a duck, consider it a duck.

image::duck-typing.png[]

*Duck typing* != weak typing

[source,groovy]
----
class Duck {
	String name
	void quack() {
		println 'Quack quack'
	}
}

def duck = new Duck()

def method = 'quack'
duck."$method"
duck."name"
----

== Properties

[source,groovy] 
----
class Battlestar {
	String name
	Integer crewsize
	Date produced
}
----

* Default everything is public
* Groovy creates getters and setters
** But you can override these, if they should have side-effects
** Not generated for private fields


== Conversion example


TODO: Make this sample in code




== Inspecting Groovy Code

*AST Browser*

* Open `groovyConsole`
* Goto AST Browser (CTRL + T)

*Decompile*

* `javap yourfile.class` -> Method signatures
* `javap -c yourfile.class` -> Readable form of bytecode




== Collections

Lots of great extensions to the Java collection framework

=== Lists

[source,java]
----
List<String> battlestars = new ArrayList<String>();
battlestars.add("Pegasus");
battlestars.add("Galactica");
----

[source,groovy]
----
def battlestars = ['Pegasus',"Galactica"]

assert battlestars.first() == 'Pegasus'
assert battlestars[0] == 'Pegasus'
assert battlestars[-1] == "Galactica"
----


=== Maps

[source,groovy]
----
def crewSize = ['Pegasus': 1752, 'Galactica': 2662]

println "Crew on Galactica=${crewSize['Galactica']}"
println "Crew on Pegasus=${crewSize.Pegasus}"
----

=== Range



== Groovy Truth


== Constructors





== Closures

* Pieces of code that can be saved as a variable
* Powerfull, fx when building DSL
* Similar to function pointers in c
* Can access nonfinal variables outside of their scope

[source,groovy]
----
def countdownRange = { int i -> i < 0 ? return  }

assert countdown.call() == '3....2....1'
assert countdown() == '3....2....1'
----

Closures can have parameters, typed or not

[source,groovy]
----
def countdown = { return '3....2....1' }

assert countdown.call() == '3....2....1'
assert countdown() == '3....2....1'
----


== When is Java not Groovy

* Initialization of arrays (Groovy uses brackets for closures)

int[] oddUnderTen = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };

Use

def oddUnderTen = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] as int[]

* New keywords: def and in

* No do/while loop in Groovy



== The Groovy JDK (GDK)


== Special operators

=== Null-Safe Dereference

  ?.

=== Elvis

Condence ternary opertors

 ?:

=== Spread

 *.

=== Spaceship

 <=> 


== Coersion using *as*

as Set

== Shortcut for contails: *in*

assert 1 in [1, 2, 5]
assert !(3 in [1, 2, 5])


== Being 'Too Groovy'
(Styleguide)

* Work smarter, but not harder
** Take advantage of smart features, but don't overdo it (making the code hard to understand)
* Overuse of`def` keyword
** Ok on left side of assignment with clear right side
*** Clear is ot a method invocation
* for/in loop vs. each
** You can break out of the for loop
* Use closures where it is necessary, and use methods where you can
** Methods specify retrn type


----------- Part two - advanced Groovy

== TypeChecked, CompileStatic, and invokedynamic

== Operator overloading




== Metaprogramming and MOP



== Closure magic: Owner, Delegate, this

== Method Reference

The .& operator lets you get a reference to a method and treat it like a closure.
