= Server config 101 and Jenkins for CI

== What is CI

"Continuous integration (CI) is a software engineering practice in which isolated changes are immediately tested and reported on when they are added to a larger code base. The goal of CI is to provide rapid feedback so that if a defect is introduced into the code base, it can be identified and corrected as soon as possible."
-- Margaret Rouse, WhatIs.com

== Jenkins

* One of many tools
* Open source
* Java based
* Fork of Hudson project (after a dispute with Oracle)
* Many plugins for extended functionality

== What can we use it for

IMPORTANT: Execute a predefined list of steps based on a certain trigger.

*Examples*

* Run performance test suite every time code is pushed to central repository
* Periodically backup database
* Publish test results
* Deploying applications


== VPS Server with Digital Ocean

Login, push *Create droplet*

* Name your droplet something recognizable
* As a start, a 10$ server with 1GB RAM is ok, later, you can rezise this to a larger
* Select a region near you (Amsterdam)
* Select OS (I'm using Ubuntu 14.04, x64)
* Optionally add a SSH key (it will enable you to login without password)
** See tutorial here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2[]

== Logging in

== Set up a non-root user

 adduser app
 usermod -a -G sudo app
 ssh app@servers.ip.address

<<<

== Install git

 sudo apt-get install git

== Installing Java

 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer




== Locating the JDK

image::locating-java.png[]



== Install Jenkins


 sudo wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
 sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
 sudo apt-get update

 sudo apt-get install jenkins
 sudo service jenkins status

If jenkins is not running

 sudo service jenkins start

Once installed, point your browser to:

 ip.of.your.server:8080

<<<

== Intial configuration

Go to _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Configure system_

In JDK Add your java installation

== Securing Jenkins

Go to _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Configure Global Security_

Select _Enable security_

As Realm, use _Jenkins own user database_ and allow users to sign up.

Select Matrix based security, and create a user fx admin, with all rigths.

== Create your user

Create the user with the name you specified before. Now disable the _Allow users to sign up_ (once you all have made your accounts)

== Adding relevant plugins

Go to _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Manage Plugins_

Update the plugins that need udating, especially the mailer plugin, and go to the *Available* tab.
Install the *git* plugin and the *Grails Plugin*, and restart Jenkins.

Optionally: Install the *ChuckNorris Plugin*

== Configuring Email

Go to _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Configure system_

*If you create a Gmail account for this, it requires a bit of massaging*

Gmail must be allowed https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps["Access for less secure apps"]
and you need to visit  https://g.co/allowaccess[] after the test mail sending fails.

== Creating a jenkins job

We wish to have our first Jenkins job doing:

* Pull from git at regular intervals
* Run the grails tests if there are changes
* Alert if tests fails
* Copy test reports so they are easily accessible

== Steps in the job

Click *New Item*, insert a fitting name *All_tests_for_MyApp* and select *Freestyle project*

== Status

image::jenkins-success.png[]

But we need to configure a few things first!

== Configure memory

Edit in */etc/default/jenkins*

 JAVA_ARGS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx512m"



== Apache Webserver in Front

Installing

 sudo apt-get install apache2

Main configuration found in _/etc/apache2/apache2.conf_

This generates the following (irrelevant) error
----
 * Starting web server apache2
 AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1.
 Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message
----

This can be fixed by putting

 ServerName localhost

In a file in  `/etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf`

Enable it with

 a2enconf servername
 service apache2 restart


== Configuring Jenkins for Apache front

Configure apache to reach jenkins at `server.ip.address/jenkins`

Make sure this is in `/etc/default/jenkins`

 PREFIX=/jenkins

 JENKINS_ARGS="--webroot=/var/cache/jenkins/war --httpPort=$HTTP_PORT --ajp13Port=$AJP_PORT --prefix=$PREFIX"

Reload with

 service jenkins force-reload

To reach jenkins you now need to access it at `server.ip.address:8080/jenkins`


== Virtual Host for Jenkins

Save this in /etc/apache2/sites-available/jenkins.conf
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin jamik@imada.sdu.dk
  DocumentRoot "/var/www"
  ErrorLog /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
  ProxyRequests off
  ProxyPass /jenkins http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins nocanon
  ProxyPassReverse /jenkins  http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins
  ProxyPreserveHost on
</VirtualHost>
----

 a2enmod proxy
 a2enmod proxy_http
 a2enmod proxy_ajp
 a2ensite jenkins.conf
 service apache2 restart


== Making test reports available

 mkdir -p /var/www/html/test-reports
 chown jenkins /var/www/html/test-reports/

And let Jenkins copy them to this repository
